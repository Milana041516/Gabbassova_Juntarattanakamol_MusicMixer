# Gabbassova_Juntarattanakamol_Music_Mixer

## Idea
We would like our "Music Mixer" webpage to be connected to our assignment for FIP. Brand that we have chosen is "Zima".
Our main idea: there should be 4 icons of musical tools, and the "music mixer" in the centre, when you drag one of the instruments and drop them in this mixer, the audio starts playing.
We are planning to use this "Music Mixer" in our website in the final FIP project: using JavaScript we want to make it as a little Quiz (Which Zima drink are you?). Foe example if the person will drag and drop specific combination of musical tools like guitar+piano+drums the webpage will reply as "Best match for you is Zima Strawberry Drink" or if it is drums+saxophone+piano the text "You will definetly like our new Zima Apple Drink".
